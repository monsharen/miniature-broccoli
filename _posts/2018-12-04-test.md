# Introduction
I just started a blog with Jekyll using Github Page and Jekyll Theme. I had no experience using some kind of blog builder like Wordpress or Middleman.

I created one in the very basic way, and still learning how to manage it and even how to write HTML, CSS. I’m going to write how I created it and what I’ve learned so far.
