# Introduction
Have you ever browsed the web on a TV screen? Why did you do it, and more importantly, did you enjoy it? Regardless of the reason why you did it, I am going to guess that it was not a pleasant experience.

I base my guess on the fact that no one is designing web pages for the TV. The internet is full of CSS tricks for making your website look good on both desktop and mobile screens, but I find little information regarding providing a good user experience on really large screens.

There's a pretty good writeup regarding [the design challenges when faced with large scale displays here](https://css-tricks.com/optimizing-large-scale-displays/), but the article only deals with the "look and feel".

Problems
- distance to screen
- rendering on a massive screen
- input suitable to distance
- visual and sound feedback when interacting with elements on screen

I suspect these problems require the following:
- Webpages need to add support for large screens
- An input designed for browsing the Internet from a couch
- A browser tailored to that specific input type

# Input

## The mouse
TV's are hooked up to all kinds of equipment. Be it entertainment systems, like the Apple TV or a Playstation, to the latest sound system. It's pretty much anything except a mouse, and the reason for that is that you're sitting really far away from the screen, and in a position which makes a mouse pretty inconvenient. Even if you do hook up a mouse you will be using it far slower than if you were sitting by a PC, and you're likely squiting as your eyes are tracking the cursor travel across the large screen.

## Touchscreens
You interact with tablets using your fingers which have led to a few design problems and interesting solutions. As a user interacts with a button their finger will temporarily cover it so any visual feedback will need a short delay so that the user has time to see it. Likely not something we need to consider when dealing with TVs as we're probably too far away to reach the screen with our fingers.

## Laser pointers
The Wii provided us with a laser pointer for navigating menus. It was fun for pressing large buttons, but it was not ideal for slow, precise movement. 

## Movement sensors
The xbox kinect lets a user navigate by moving their body in room space. Cool, but tiring. Not for couch potatos like me.

## Keyboard
A keyboard is great when sitting on a desk. Try putting one in your lap. Ugh.
