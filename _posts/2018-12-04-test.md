# Introduction
Have you ever browsed the web on a TV screen? Why did you do it, and more importantly, did you enjoy it? Regardless of the reason why you did it, I am going to guess that it was not a pleasant experience.

I base my guess on the fact that no one is designing web pages for the TV. The internet is full of CSS tricks for making your website look good on both desktop and mobile screens, but I find little information regarding providing a good user experience on really large screens.

There's a pretty good writeup regarding [the design challenges when faced with large scale displays here](https://css-tricks.com/optimizing-large-scale-displays/), but the article only deals with the "look and feel".

# Input
TV's are hooked up to all kinds of equipment. Be it entertainment systems, like the Apple TV or a Playstation, to the latest sound system. It's pretty much anything except a mouse. And the reason for that is that you're sitting really far away from the screen, and in a position which makes a mouse pretty inconvenient.

Tablets use fingers, but again, we're too far away.
